    Use the spring/repulsion model of Fruchterman and Reingold (1991):
        Attractive force:  f_a(d) =  d^2 / k
        Repulsive force:  f_r(d) = -k^2 / d
    where d is distance between two vertices and the optimal distance
    between vertices k is defined as C * sqrt( area / num_vertices )
    where C is a parameter we can adjust

    Arguments:
    adj_matrix Adjacency matrix of some type. Non-zero of the eltype
               of the matrix is used to determine if a link exists,
               but currently no sense of magnitude
    C          Constant to fiddle with density of resulting layout
    MAXITER    Number of iterations we apply the forces
    INITTEMP   Initial "temperature", controls movement per iteration
