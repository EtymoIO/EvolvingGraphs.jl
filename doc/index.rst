EvolvingGraphs: Dynamic Graph Analysis in Julia
===============================================

**EvolvingGraphs** is a Julia software package for the creation,
manipulation, and study of time-dependent networks.  

The area of evolving graph is a relatively new but increasingly
popular research area. It is concerned with modelling time-dependent 
network problems with the aim of understanding information flow 
through a network.
