Main Features
=============

Here are the main features:

* A variety of data types for working with evolving graphs.

  - TimeEdge
  - WeightedTimeEdge
  - TimeGraph
  - EvolvingGraph     
  - WeightedEvolvingGraph

* a collection of evolving graph algorithms.

  - Katz centrality
  - random evolving graph
  - more algorithms are being implemented

* io 

  - read data from Evolving Graph Exchange Format file.

* All data structures and algorithms are implemented in *pure Julia*.
