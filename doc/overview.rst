  - TimeEdge
  - WeightedTimeEdge
  - TimeGraph
  - EvolvingGraph     
  - WeightedEvolvingGraph
  - MatrixList
  - AttributeEvolvingGraph

* a collection of evolving graph algorithms.

  - Katz centrality
  - random evolving graph
  - more algorithms are being implemented

* io 

  - read/write the Evolving Graph Exchange Format file.

* All data structures and algorithms are implemented in *Julia*.
